sor where he has occasion to extract trum other
authors, or to give insertion to state documents,
his truthfulness aud aecuracy are proved by the
fact that these, with the exception os an occa-
sional clerical error, are osten nearer to original
contemporary MSS. than those which appear in

⁹ the great collections os Wilkins or Rymer. His
style is smooth, clear, aud agreeable3 some-

Chronicle of Dunstable, andos occasional inter·
polations, which bear the evident stamp ot a
much later age. For this reason Walsingham
must be read with caution3 for though his iuter·
polations in the portion he has appropriatcd
from Trivet are not many, aud comparatively
unimportant, it is not so in succeeding reigns,
